Desired Design
==============

xWave downloads waves as constantly updating XML. iWave needs to translate this to a UIView structure with an editing mode. 

I plan to use XML since I'd need to use it anyways, and for both a change and ease, I'll provide tag based translation with a selection of UIView tags to translate to.

Modes can be extended to include the play and normal modes as well as edit (which needs to focus on a post). They would also include modes within the structure like contrib and search modes. 

The paradigm can be extended further to the master controller (stored XML -> inboxes -> search results) with a slight adjustment to include cells, which would also help with popovers. 

So, all the UI covered by the UI document would be programmed in live XML tag based translation overlayed with modes which are processed between ordinary XML and the UIView translation.
